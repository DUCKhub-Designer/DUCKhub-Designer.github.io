    <p>
        Hi there trios student who goes by Daniel, a creative spirit with a passion for music coding and design 
        and a passion for bringing unique ideas to life! Zen master, self taught developer 
        artist and moive buff. Im driven by my belief that best things come from following your own path 
        even if its conventional.

        When im not In the kitchen meaning both ways it be music or whipping up something fancy
        on the stove, i like going for nature walks, watching old movies, and expolring my city

        You'll probaly find me with a coffee in hand seeking inspiration the simplest of the simplest
        things and a ladybug crossing my eye in the sky or a pretty girl walking by but her hair 
        colour doesnt match.

        Professionally, I’m driven by creativity and problem-solving, always eager to bring fresh ideas to any project I work on. My background has given me a strong foundation in [mention relevant skills or field, e.g., "web development" or "graphic design"], but I'm constantly exploring ways to expand my expertise and push the boundaries of what I can create. I value collaboration and enjoy working with others to bring out the best in each idea. Ultimately, my goal is to make a positive impact with my work and continue growing, both personally and professionally.

        <h2>My Hobbies/Samples</h2>
        <p>
            In my free time, I love diving into new adventures and discovering the world in unique ways. Hiking is a big passion of mine—I enjoy finding hidden trails and being surrounded by nature's beauty, which gives me a sense of peace and a chance to recharge. I’m also an avid trivia enthusiast, always eager to learn something new and challenge myself with fun facts and random knowledge. Whether I'm outdoors exploring or immersed in a brain-teasing quiz, I find joy in experiences that push me to grow and see things from different perspectives.

            On a quieter note, I enjoy sipping a good cup of coffee each morning, which has become a ritual that kick-starts my day. I also love music and spend time discovering new artists or revisiting my favorite classics. Music has a way of connecting deeply with emotions, and I often find inspiration in the melodies and lyrics. These hobbies give me a perfect balance of excitement and calm, making my days both dynamic and fulfilling.
        </p><br>
        <p>I'm always looking to grow and learn. My goals include [meeting pharrel williams, get a mansion, spread the word]. I'm excited to see where my journey takes me next!</p>
